# Tutorial Questions

## Prelude

If you are *not* familar with Git, make sure you complete `git.md` in your lab01 repo before attempting anything else.

If you have not set up Java locally, make sure you complete `java_setup.md` in your lab01 repo before attempting anything else.

Note: I *highly* recommend setting up Java locally even though you can work on a CSE machine. Java is a platform independent language meaning it should work on any operating system.

Another Note: I *highly* recommend setting up the VSCode Java extensions. It's going to be a lot easier to program with autocomplete in a language as verbose as Java.

Please ask via email or the forum if you need any help with above.

## Code

I have added comments to explain the code examples in this tute. I recommend reading them in the following order:
1. `src/HelloWorld.java`
2. `src/Sum.java`
3. `src/Shouter.java`
